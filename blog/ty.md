# TY

I started creating Testo for myself because no existing testing framework could meet my needs.

However, after I talked about it at a PHP Random Beer meetup, I realized that the upcoming Testo features resonated with my fellow drinkers, and that I wasn't the only one with complaints about existing frameworks.

Then the information about Testo [leaked to a local "plausible" news outlet](https://t.me/php_fart/282) and others started learning about the project. That same day, my first sponsor reached out.

::: danger 💥 I saw the demand and I felt the support. This changed my attitude towards the project.

What I thought would be "thrown together in a few evenings" at the start turned into something bigger: today Testo is a **full-fledged testing framework** with a well-thought-out architecture, its own assertion system, and even its own IDE plugin. Who would have thought it would take off like this?

Now, with the launch of the landing page and documentation, I see your stars coming into [Testo's Github](https://github.com/php-testo/testo): you see the project's vision and you support it.


**Thank you, this is invaluable!**
